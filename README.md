# Dataset Description

The provided dataset contains information about different posts on an online platform. Each row represents a post and includes the following columns:

- **id:** A unique identifier for each post.
- **title:** The title or headline of the post.
- **url:** The URL of the post.
- **num_points:** The number of points or upvotes received by the post.
- **num_comments:** The number of comments made on the post.
- **author:** The username or author of the post.
- **created_at:** The date and time when the post was created.

# Code Description

The provided Python script is designed to analyze the dataset "hacker_news.csv" and extract valuable insights from the posts on the online platform "Hacker News." The code is written in Python and utilizes the `csv` and `datetime` modules for data processing and date-time conversions.

**Step 1: Importing Necessary Modules**
The script starts by importing the essential modules: `csv` for reading the CSV file and `datetime` as `dt` for handling date and time data.

**Step 2: Reading and Preparing the Dataset**
The code opens the CSV file, reads its contents, and stores it in the variable `hn` as a list of lists. The first element in `hn` contains the headers, which are extracted into `headers` for reference. The dataset `hn` is then modified to exclude the header row.

**Step 3: Separating Posts by Type**
The script categorizes the posts into three separate lists: `ask_posts` for "Ask HN" posts, `show_posts` for "Show HN" posts, and `other_posts` for all other posts based on their titles.

**Step 4: Calculating Total and Average Comments for "Ask HN" Posts**
The code calculates the total number of comments and the average number of comments per "Ask HN" post. It iterates through the `ask_posts` list, computes the total comments, and then divides it by the total number of "Ask HN" posts to obtain the average.

**Step 5: Calculating Total and Average Comments for "Show HN" Posts**
Similarly, the script calculates the total number of comments and the average number of comments per "Show HN" post using the `show_posts` list.

**Step 6: Extracting Hourly Comments Data**
The script creates a new list `result_list` containing the creation date and the number of comments for each "Ask HN" post. It then uses this list to create two dictionaries: `counts_by_hour` to store the number of posts created in each hour and `comments_by_hour` to store the total number of comments for posts created in each hour.

**Step 7: Calculating Average Comments per Hour**
Using the data in `counts_by_hour` and `comments_by_hour`, the script calculates the average number of comments per post for each hour and stores it in the list of lists `avg_by_hour`.

**Step 8: Sorting and Displaying Top Hours for Comments**
The script sorts the `avg_by_hour` list in descending order based on the average number of comments per hour. It then presents the top five hours with the highest average comments per post in a readable format.

This Python script provides a clear and concise analysis of the dataset, allowing users to understand the patterns and trends in comments for different types of posts on "Hacker News."
